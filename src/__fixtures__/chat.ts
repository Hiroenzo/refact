      "The Mars Rover Kata is a coding exercise that simulates the movement of a rover on the surface of Mars. The goal is to write a program that takes in a series of commands and outputs the final position of the rover.\n\nHere is a link to the official Mars Rover Kata documentation: https://kata-log.rocks/mars-rover-kata\n\nYou can find various implementations and solutions to the Mars Rover Kata on platforms like GitHub or coding challenge websites.",

      "Certainly! Here's an example solution to the Mars Rover Kata in OCaml:\n\n```ocaml\ntype direction = North | East | South | West\n\ntype rover = {\n  x : int;\n  y : int;\n  dir : direction;\n}\n\nlet move_forward rover =\n  match rover.dir with\n  | North -> { rover with y = rover.y + 1 }\n  | East -> { rover with x = rover.x + 1 }\n  | South -> { rover with y = rover.y - 1 }\n  | West -> { rover with x = rover.x - 1 }\n\nlet turn_left rover =\n  match rover.dir with\n  | North -> { rover with dir = West }\n  | East -> { rover with dir = North }\n  | South -> { rover with dir = East }\n  | West -> { rover with dir = South }\n\nlet turn_right rover =\n  match rover.dir with\n  | North -> { rover with dir = East }\n  | East -> { rover with dir = South }\n  | South -> { rover with dir = West }\n  | West -> { rover with dir = North }\n\nlet execute_command rover command =\n  match command with\n  | 'F' -> move_forward rover\n  | 'L' -> turn_left rover\n  | 'R' -> turn_right rover\n  | _ -> rover (* Ignore unknown commands *)\n\nlet rec execute_commands rover commands =\n  match commands with\n  | [] -> rover\n  | command :: rest ->\n    let new_rover = execute_command rover command in\n    execute_commands new_rover rest\n\nlet initial_rover = { x = 0; y = 0; dir = North }\n\nlet final_rover = execute_commands initial_rover ['F'; 'R'; 'F'; 'F'; 'L'; 'F']\n\nlet () =\n  Printf.printf \"Final position: (%d, %d), facing %s\\n\"\n    final_rover.x final_rover.y\n    (match final_rover.dir with\n    | North -> \"North\"\n    | East -> \"East\"\n    | South -> \"South\"\n    | West -> \"West\")\n```\n\nThis solution defines the necessary types, functions, and commands to simulate the movement of the rover. The `execute_commands` function takes in a rover and a list of commands and iteratively executes each command to update the rover's position and direction. Finally, the `final_rover` is printed to the console.\n\nYou can run this code in an OCaml environment or compile it using an OCaml compiler.",
